I am trying to migrate from rogeriohsjr.blogspot to githubpages, to give it a try. This post will have my finds:

1. For me was hard to find a template, I liked some but I decided to create my own to learn more and explore something new.

2. Github-pages are pure html, css and javascript, so I figured out that won't be hard to develop the way I want, since I like to have more control over things.

3. My Github-pages uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}
